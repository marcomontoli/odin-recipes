# Odin Recipes

For this project, I built a basic recipe website as part of The Odin Project.

The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. It doesn't look very pretty yet, but the purpose of this project was to practice my HTML skills. I will revisit this project in the future to style it with CSS.
